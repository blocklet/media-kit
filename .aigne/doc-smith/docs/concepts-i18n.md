# Internationalization (i18n)

The `@blocklet/uploader` component is designed for a global audience and comes with built-in support for multiple languages. This is achieved by extending the robust internationalization (i18n) system provided by its underlying engine, Uppy. You can easily switch between pre-configured languages or even provide your own custom translations to tailor the user interface text to your specific needs.

## Switching Languages

The simplest way to change the display language is by using the `locale` prop. By default, the uploader interface is in English (`en`). The component also includes a built-in Chinese (`zh`) locale.

To set the language, simply pass the corresponding language code to the `locale` prop:

```jsx
import Uploader from '@blocklet/uploader/react';

function App() {
  // To display the uploader in Chinese
  return <Uploader locale="zh" />;
}
```

To revert to the default English interface, you can either pass `locale="en"` or omit the prop entirely.

## Customizing Locales

For more advanced control, such as overriding specific text strings or adding a new language, you can pass a full locale object directly to `coreProps.locale`. This object allows you to define custom strings that will be merged with Uppy's base translations.

### Overriding Existing Strings

You can change any text in the interface by providing your own version. It is recommended to import the base locale from Uppy, clone it, and merge your changes to ensure all other strings have a fallback.

Here is an example of how to change the "browse" text in the English locale:

```jsx
import Uploader from '@blocklet/uploader/react';
import en_US from '@uppy/locales/lib/en_US';
import merge from 'lodash/merge';

// Create a custom locale object by merging our changes into Uppy's base English locale
const customEnglishLocale = merge(
  { ...en_US }, // Deep clone the base locale
  {
    strings: {
      browse: 'select your files',
      dropHint: 'You can drop your files here',
    },
  }
);

function App() {
  return (
    <Uploader
      coreProps={{
        locale: customEnglishLocale,
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

### Adding a New Language

The process for adding a new, unsupported language is similar. You would import a base locale from Uppy (if one exists for your target language) and then merge in your translations for the custom strings specific to `@blocklet/uploader`.

## Available Custom Strings

The `@blocklet/uploader` component adds several custom strings to the Uppy defaults. The following table lists the keys and their default English values that you can override.

| `aiImageGenerate` | Generate |
| `aiImageGenerating` | Generating... |
| `browse` | browse |
| `browseFiles` | browse files |
| `browseFolders` | browse folders |
| `dropHint` | Drop your files here |
| `dropPasteBoth` | Drop files here, paste, %{browseFiles} or %{browseFolders} |
| `dropPasteFiles` | Drop files here, paste or %{browseFiles} |
| `dropPasteFolders` | Drop files here, paste or %{browseFolders} |
| `dropPasteImportBoth` | Drop files here, paste, %{browseFiles}, %{browseFolders} or import from: |
| `dropPasteImportFiles` | Drop files here, paste, %{browseFiles} or import from: |
